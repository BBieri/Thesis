# Thesis

This repository contains the replication code to replicate the thesis
“THESIS TITLE” by Bernhard Bieri in fulfillment of the Master in
International Economics of the Geneva Graduate Institute.

## How to replicate this thesis:

All code files are located in the `R/` folder and are labeled according
to the order in which they should be executed. I.e. the first file to
run would be the `0_Setup.R` file followed by the files in the
`1_DataPreparation` folder.

When executing the scripts, you might need to install/load particular
versions of the loaded packages. These are indicated in comments next to
the corresponding `library()` call in the corresponding file.
