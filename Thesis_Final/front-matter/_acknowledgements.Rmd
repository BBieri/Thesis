I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. JoÃ«lle Noailly for
her supervision without which the present work would not exist. Her guidance
on how to address methodological challenges as well as her insight in the field
of environmental economics proved to be invaluable in the writing of this
thesis.
Additionally, I would like to thank Prof. James Hollway for the co-supervision
of this thesis and in particular for the collaboration within the PANARCHIC project
which allowed me to continuously refine my programming skills and discover 
the social network analysis methodology which lies at the core of the present
work.
Finally, I would like to thank my friends and my family without whose support,
feedback, and advice this work would not have been possible.
