Additional resources as well as all code files to replicate the present
work can be found on its
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/BBieri/Thesis). The repository
is currently private but feel free to reach out via
[email](mailto:bernhard.bieri@graduateinstitute.ch) to get access.

All code files are located in the R/ folder and are labeled according to the
order in which they should be executed. I.e. the first file to run would be the
`0_Setup.R` file followed by the files in the `1_DataPreparation` folder.

When executing the scripts, you might need to install/load particular versions
of the loaded packages. These are indicated in comments next to the
corresponding `library()` call in the corresponding file.

If you have any specific questions regarding the replication of the thesis,
