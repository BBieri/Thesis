# Conclusion {#conclusion}

Main theoretical interpretation of our results --> choosing backbone extraction method
needs to be empirically founded and if not possible to distinguiosh use robustness checks
to determine if results are contingent.

Main policy implications of our results
  WPH seems satisfied
  Importance of transitivity, e.g. a stable and predictable political environment
  to foster innovation
  SPH not verified and needs more empirical estimations

Main issues faced

Refining the modelling of the network extraction method
Refining the

Further avenues of research
