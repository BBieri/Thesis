# Litterature Review {#litreview}

The present paper draws from three distinct but complementary strands of
the literature on environmental policy. First and foremost, we ought to
characterize what is known in the literature as the *Porter Hypothesis* and
distinguish the different versions that have been devised over the years.
We will thus strive to understand the impact of increased environmental regulations
on both innovative activity of firms and on overall firm performance before
completing the analysis by highlighting works that looked at the impact of the
nature of environmental policy on firm-level innovation.
The next strand of the literature relates to the concept of *policy certainty*
which highlights the importance of designing policies that 
Finally, and most central to our contribution, lies the
literature on *International Environmental Governance* and the related methodological
advances to understand it within a network framework.

## The Porter Hypothesis

Over three decades ago, the Porter Hypothesis (PH) challenged the conventional
Panglossian economic thinking that enhanced environmental regulation would
lead to a decrease in economic performance of firms due to the increased
constraints imposed on the firm [@michael1991america]. The main intuition behind the
Panglossian doxa is that if it were profitable for firms to follow a more
sustainable production path, they would do so in the absence of regulations.
On the basis of case studies, Porter however argues that well designed,
market-based, pollution preventing policies would lead firms to create products
that are more resource efficient and thus competitive on the international
market. An example of the latter could be the implementation of more stringent
fuel consumption standards for cars. Porter thus advances that this
increase in environmental stringency, would force domestic automobile
companies to make more fuel efficient cars which in turn would increase
the competitiveness of domestic cars in the world market. 

Porter and Von der Linde later formalize his initial criticism in 
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 where they outline six main
causal links between increased environmental regulations and innovation or
firm performance. First, they contend that "regulation signals companies about
likely resource inefficiencies and potential technological improvements.
Second, they argue that "regulation focused on information gathering
can achieve major benefits [in terms of environmental performance and
economic performance] by raising corporate awareness". Third, they
mention that "environmental regulation reduces the "uncertainty that
investments to address the environment will be valuable". Fourth,
they advance that outside pressure, which includes the regulatory framework
firms have to comply with, is able to overcome organizational inertia and
motivate innovation. The fifth reason put forward by the authors is that
"regulation levels the transitional playing field" in the sense that regulation
ensures that companies do not gain an unfair advantage until new and improved
technologies are proven. The sixth and final argument pertains to an important
nuance between the effect of regulation on innovation and competitiveness of
firms in that compliance costs arising from environmental regulations might not
always be offset by benefits brought by product innovations. Crucially, Porter
and Van der Linde contend that most benefits occurring from increased innovation
will arise in the medium to the long term due to the required time span for the
innovation to bear fruits. Hence the existence of a lag between the implementation
of an environmental regulation and a signal on innovation or economic performance
metrics of firms is likely.

Due to its unorthodox nature, the Porter Hypothesis generated a strong debate 
among economists during the late 1990's and the early 2000's
[@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationCompetitiveness1995].
@ambecPorterHypothesis202013 provide a clear overview of the various arguments
proponents used to defend the *PH*. They define a first set of studies which
underlines the fact that firms are driven by individuals who might not
satisfy the assumptions of rationality required for firms to be deemed
profit-maximizers. Indeed, managerial risk-aversion, resistance to change
[@aghionCorporateGovernanceCompetition1997], and
a combination of lacking information and the cognitive capabilities to
process the latter [@gabel2001firm] may cause a mismatch between the utility
maximizing behaviors of the management and the firm as a whole. Akin to this
principal agent issue, @ambecTheoreticalFoundationPorter2002 argue that managers
may exhibit rent-seeking behavior by retaining private information on
the true costs of technological innovations that would improve productivity
and the environmental performance of the firm. This essentially
follows the organizational inertia and learning effects put forward by
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 and outlined above.

A second strand of the theoretical literature explore the role of market
failures beyond the pure environmental externalities generated by pollution
and how increased environmental regulations could overcome them.
Examples of this strand include situations where firms are first movers
within international markets characterized by imperfect competition where
domestic production may increase as a result of more stringent environmental
regulation [@simpsonTaxingVariableCost1996]. Another common market failure
that could lead to the coexistence of the *PH* alongside profit-maximizing firms
are information asymmetries between households and firms.
The main idea here is that by setting industry standards or labels, firms
are able to credibly communicate the environmental benefits of their products
and overcome the asymmetry [@ambecSurvolFondementsTheoriques2007].
Finally, the non-exclusive nature of R&D may lead to spillovers from the
innovating firm to other firms in the industry. This may lead the economy
to be in a bad equilibrium where firms invest too little in environmental
technologies. If this is indeed the case, then regulations can level the playing
field among firms and lead to a move to the higher, more R&D intensive
equilibrium [@mohrTechnicalChangeExternal2002].

On the empirical front, much has been written to reinforce the initially very
theoretical debate surrounding the Porter Hypothesis.
To facilitate its analysis, @jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997
divided the original hypothesis into three distinct ones. What is known as
the "Strong Porter Hypothesis" (*SPH*) links environmental regulation to firm
competitiveness. The "Weak Porter Hypothesis" (*WPH*) links regulation to innovation,
and the "Narrow Porter Hypothesis" argues that flexible market-based
regulations are more effective in generating innovation than stricter
command-and-control policies^[Since we will focus on the former two
two hypotheses, we will not elaborate on the "narrow" hypothesis in this
literature review.].

The empirical literature analyzing the weak version of the Porter Hypothesis
usually operationalizes innovation as R&D expenditures or through
(aggregate or sector specific) patent counts. When instead analysing the
strong version of the *PH* studies usually rely on firm profits.
On the right hand side, the
independent variable, environmental policy stringency, was initially proxied
by pollution abatement costs [@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997] or 
energy prices [@newellInducedInnovationHypothesis1999] before being more
holistically estimated via the use of indicators such as the Environmental Policy Stringency (*EPS*) indicator
developed by the OECD [@kruseMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2022] or national
firm-level surveys such as the Community Innovation Survey^[See
@cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018 for a recent meta-analysis of
the Porter Hypothesis and an outline of the different measures used.] [@eurostatCommunityInnovationSurvey2022].
As we will outline more in detail in section 3 of the paper, we will take
the modern approach and use the EPS index to proxy for environmental regulation
stringency at the domestic level and patent counts and business R&D
expenditures to proxy inventive activity of firms.
The weak version of the Porter Hypothesis is found to be the most consistently
verified hypothesis among the three as outlined in the meta-analysis by @cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018. The authors of the meta-analysis
namely highlight the following points:

- Early studies tend to find a negative relationship between environmental
stringency and innovation/competitiveness. More recent studies find a
positive relationship between the two variables.
- Cross-country studies are more likely to find a positive link than
firm-level studies. One possible reason for this can be found in the fact that 
innovative activity of upstream equipment manufacturers or new entrants may also 
respond to changes in the regulatory frameworks within an industry [@noaillyDirectingTechnicalChange2015; @sanyalProductMarketCompetition2013]^[Furthermore, 
@cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018 note
that "[t]o the extent that the Porter Hypothesis as originally 
formulated focused on the competitiveness of nations, this finding is of
particular interest [...]". In other words, since the original *PH* focused
on nations as the unit of analysis, it is natural to take this unit of
analysis when empirically testing it.].
- Studies incorporating a temporal lag between the change in regulation
stringency and inventive or profitability outcomes are more likely to
find a positive relationship. This echoes once again the original formulation
of the Porter Hypothesis which states that while regulation may hurt short
term competitiveness and productivity, the long term effects would be positive.

These findings will guide us in the elaboration of a panel model
that will be outlined in more detail in section 3. Let us now turn our
attention to the second strand of literature use to guide our empirical strategy
and examine the impact of policy (un-)certainty on innovation.

## The Role of Policy Certainty on the Innovative Behavior of Firms


While the empirical literature on the impact of policy certainty on innovation
is more
recent and less abundant than the one investigating the Porter Hypothesis,
a number of papers have investigated it.
The literature of the impact of policy certainty on innovative
activity was derived from the one that links policy uncertainty and investments
in tangible assets. Early theoretical contributions outline that non-reversible
investments are often delayed or scrapped if firms experience regulatory
uncertainty via an increase in the utility derived from the status-quo^[See
@bernankeIrreversibilityUncertaintyCyclical1983 and
@bloomTradeInducedTechnical2016 for respectively a seminal and a
recent theoretical model.].
On the empirical front, @alesinaIncomeDistributionPolitical1996 were the first
to investigate this link with a cross-section analysis of over 70 countries.
More specifically, they find that more unequal countries are more likely to
be politically unstable and political instability in itself has an adverse
effect on investments in tangible assets. Additional empirical evidence
highlighting the negative effect of policy uncertainty was provided by
@bloomUncertaintyInvestmentDynamics2007 who extend the analysis to a panel model,
@julioPoliticalUncertaintyCorporate2012 who highlight a negative impact of being
in an election year on firm investments, and
@gulenPolicyUncertaintyCorporate2016 who leverage the Economic Policy
Uncertainty index developed by @bakerMeasuringEconomicPolicy2016 to
describe a similar effect within a panel analysis.

This negative effect between uncertainty and tangible asset
investments need not hold for intangible investments in R&D
since the latter are different and are namely characterized by
a long-term horizon and a fat tailed risk
distribution^[This characteristic is a product of the trial and
error nature of the R&D process where only a small subset of research
endeavors are successful and profitable.].
@bhattacharyaWhatAffectsInnovation2017 were the
first to investigate the effect of policy uncertainty on innovation outcomes (i.e. 
patent quantities and citations) empirically. They extend the theoretical
model proposed by @edmansBlockholderTradingMarket2009 on managerial myopia
by adding economic uncertainty, a measure of policy state and a measure of
policy uncertainty. Using this theoretical framework, they test whether
the pure effect of country level policy orientation as proxied by the Database
of Political Institutions and
more crucially in our case whether policy uncertainty, as proxied by
the occurrence of election events, have an impact on firm-level innovation
[@keefer2012database]. Crucially, they are able to show that innovation
is more affected by policy uncertainty than by policy itself. This leads
to the conclusion that a politically stable environment is beneficial to
long-term and high tail risk investments.

These studies are looking at the aggregate level effect between policy
certainty and innovation.
More recently however, newspaper indices on both climate policy uncertainty
[@gavriilidisMeasuringClimatePolicy2021] and on
climate policy salience became available [@noaillyHeardNewsEnvironmental2021].
These indexes are both built by programmatically analyzing US newspaper
articles over a given period to detect the co-occurrence of a given set of
words^[Both follow the methodology outlined in the Economic Policy
Uncertainty index developed by @bakerMeasuringEconomicPolicy2016 and apply
different keywords to the programmatic analysis of US newspapers.].
@gavriilidisMeasuringClimatePolicy2021 used his index to show that
increased policy uncertainty lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions.
He further argues that, this might be due to either a decrease in energy
consumption and a reduction in non-essential transport or an increase in
the demand for renewable energy consumption and an associated increase in
climate-friendly innovations.
On the other hand@noailly2021heard were able to leverage their policy salience
index to
demonstrate a positive link between policy salience and the probability
of cleantech startups receiving venture capital funding.
While these indices are able to inform research on the link between
environmental policy uncertainty/salience and innovative inputs and outcomes
for the US, they cannot yet be used within a panel framework. Furthermore,
these indices are symptomatic in that they capture perceptions of an aggregate
policy environment. As both papers outline the aggregate sentiment as proxied
by newspaper articles, they do not consider the causes of this uncertainty or
salience.

This leads us to consider the potential variables which influence domestic
environmental policy certainty and may guide innovative activity. Some of
these factors have been outlined in the international relations and political
science literature and will be more closely analyzed in the next subsection.
