This paper investigates the link between environmental policy stringency,
innovation and firm competitiveness which is commonly known as the Porter Hypothesis in
OECD countries between 1990 and 2015.
Unlike previous studies, we consider the evolution of international
environmental policy and extend the traditional domestic policy analysis by using a
network analysis approach to understand international environmental
cooperation patterns over time. To understand the relationship between international
cooperation and innovation or firm competitiveness, we define two country-level
measures of embeddedness in the international governance network; strenght and
transitivity.
We find that lagged cooperative intensity as proxied by the strength of a country in the network
does not have a significant effect on innovation or competitiveness. We however
find that domestic environmental policy stringency has a positive effect on
innovation as proxied by R&D expenditures but not on patent counts. Finally,
we find that social capital proxied by transitivity, which is conducive to a
stable international policy environment positively affects innovation
but not competitiveness.
