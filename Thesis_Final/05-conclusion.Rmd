# Conclusion {#conclusion}

We conclude by highlighting the main contributions of the present work to the
describing the intertemporal evolution of the international environmental
collaboration network and in particular its impact as a policy signal encouraging
innovation.
We were able to consistently identify a positive impact of
social capital proxied by transitivity on our measures of innovation. This
effect is larger than the pure effect of domestic policy stringency which
underlines the importance of a stable environmental governance environment
to reduce the political risk emanating from changing policies. It also shows
that global environmental cooperation can take on such a risk reducing role
by being tightly knit which would in turn favor future cooperation
due to the building of trust among actors in the network.
This stands in contrast to the results we obtained for strength centrality which
provided less consistent point estimates across lag and backbone specifications
and are smaller overall than transitivity.
Although less consistent, the fact that indirect effects of international
environmental governance supplant direct effects resonates with
@bhattacharyaWhatAffectsInnovation2017 who find that it is policy uncertainty that
affects innovation rather than policy itself. Finally, we nuance this last point
as we were able to confirm the weak version of the Porter Hypothesis in the
R&D expenditures model within the five year lag but not in the one year lag
specification which is consistent with the results of
@martinez-zarzosoDoesEnvironmentalPolicy2019, @rubashkinaEnvironmentalRegulationCompetitiveness2015, and
@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationCompetitiveness1995. We therefore conclude that
a mix of stringent domestic policy associated with a stable, tightly knit position
within the international environmental cooperation network is likely conducive
to innovative activity.

Two main empirical puzzles remain that will need to be addressed in future
research endeavors. First, we find that environmental innovation is less
affected by environmental policy stringency in the short term than total innovation.
This difference disappears in the 5 year lag specification. This goes against our
initial hypothesis that there would be a relatively stronger effect on environmental
innovation. A sectoral level analysis linking research funding and innovation outputs
would allow us to perform more precise estimations. We would furthermore be able to
leverage the full richness of the Ecolex dataset used in this study by disaggregating
international environmental agreements in specific sectors and match them with
the corresponding economic sector [@unepiucnfaoECOLEXGatewayEnvironmental2022].
The second puzzle that remains to be addressed are the unusually high coefficient estimations
for our environmental policy stringency proxy as well as inconsistencies in the
point estimates of the international policy variables across specifications
in the model testing the strong version of the Porter Hypothesis. We therefore
cannot confidently confirm the latter and further research to improve
the econometric modelling is required.

Concurrently to these empirical findings, our study furthers the theoretical
understanding of the implications behind the choice of backbone extraction methods to correct
the weighted projections of bipartite networks. These choices are often key to
correct inference and when a choice between two algorithms cannot be theoretically
justified, both should be taken into account to ensure robust inference.
In our case, the main difference between the two algorithms that were retained on
theoretical grounds are that that the confidence intervals of our coefficient estimates
tend to be larger in the model imposing harsher constraints on the set of
simulated networks since it retained less edges in the corrected projection
of the cooperation network. Since we might not have detected effects if we only
reported a single backbone extraction method, we recommend that future research
consider multiple theoretically founded extraction methods.
