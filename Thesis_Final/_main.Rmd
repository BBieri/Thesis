In section 2, we review the existing literature on Porter's Hypothesis and
the effect of policy certainty on innovation, and the emerging literature
on the network analysis of the global environmental governance complex. In
section 3, we define the computation of the two environmental governance
network metrics that will proxy the effect of international policymaking
on innovation. Furthermore, we will define our empirical strategy and
provide the reader with descriptive statistics of the main variables of interest.
In section 4, we present and discuss the results stemming from our empirical
estimation. Finally, we wrap up in section 5 and provide pathways for
further studies in this up-and-coming field.

# Litterature Review {#litreview}

The present paper draws from three distinct but complementary strands of
the literature on environmental policy. First and foremost, we ought to
characterize what is known in the literature as the *Porter Hypothesis* and
distinguish the different versions that have been devised over the years.
We will thus strive to understand the impact of increased environmental regulations
on both innovative activity of firms and on overall firm performance before
completing the analysis by highlighting works that looked at the impact of the
nature of environmental policy on firm-level innovation.
The next strand of the literature relates to the concept of *policy certainty*
which highlights the importance of designing policies that 
Finally, and most central to our contribution, lies the
literature on *International Environmental Governance* and the related methodological
advances to understand it within a network framework.

## The Porter Hypothesis

Over three decades ago, the Porter Hypothesis (PH) challenged the conventional
Panglossian economic thinking that enhanced environmental regulation would
lead to a decrease in economic performance of firms due to the increased
constraints imposed on the firm [@michael1991america]. The main intuition behind the
Panglossian doxa is that if it were profitable for firms to follow a more
sustainable production path, they would do so in the absence of regulations.
On the basis of case studies, Porter however argues that well designed,
market-based, pollution preventing policies would lead firms to create products
that are more resource efficient and thus competitive on the international
market. An example of the latter could be the implementation of more stringent
fuel consumption standards for cars. Porter thus advances that this
increase in environmental stringency, would force domestic automobile
companies to make more fuel efficient cars which in turn would increase
the competitiveness of domestic cars in the world market. 

Porter and Von der Linde later formalize his initial criticism in 
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 where they outline six main
causal links between increased environmental regulations and innovation or
firm performance. First, they contend that "regulation signals companies about
likely resource inefficiencies and potential technological improvements.
Second, they argue that "regulation focused on information gathering
can achieve major benefits [in terms of environmental performance and
economic performance] by raising corporate awareness". Third, they
mention that "environmental regulation reduces the "uncertainty that
investments to address the environment will be valuable". Fourth,
they advance that outside pressure, which includes the regulatory framework
firms have to comply with, is able to overcome organizational inertia and
motivate innovation. The fifth reason put forward by the authors is that
"regulation levels the transitional playing field" in the sense that regulation
ensures that companies do not gain an unfair advantage until new and improved
technologies are proven. The sixth and final argument pertains to an important
nuance between the effect of regulation on innovation and competitiveness of
firms in that compliance costs arising from environmental regulations might not
always be offset by benefits brought by product innovations. Crucially, Porter
and Van der Linde contend that most benefits occurring from increased innovation
will arise in the medium to the long term due to the required time span for the
innovation to bear fruits. Hence the existence of a lag between the implementation
of an environmental regulation and a signal on innovation or economic performance
metrics of firms is to be expected.

Due to its unorthodox nature, the Porter Hypothesis generated a strong debate 
among economists during the late 1990's and the early 2000's
[@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationCompetitiveness1995].
@ambecPorterHypothesis202013 provide a clear overview of the various arguments
proponents used to defend the *PH*. They define a first set of studies which
underlines the fact that firms are driven by individuals who might not
satisfy the assumptions of rationality required for firms to be deemed
profit-maximizers. Indeed, managerial risk-aversion, resistance to change
[@aghionCorporateGovernanceCompetition1997], and
a combination of lacking information and the cognitive capabilities to
process the latter [@gabel2001firm] may cause a mismatch between the utility
maximizing behaviors of the management and the firm as a whole. Akin to this
principal agent issue, @ambecTheoreticalFoundationPorter2002 argue that managers
may exhibit rent-seeking behavior by retaining private information on
the true costs of technological innovations that would improve productivity
and the environmental performance of the firm. This essentially
follows the organizational inertia and learning effects put forward by
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 and outlined above.

A second strand of the theoretical literature explore the role of market
failures beyond the pure environmental externalities generated by pollution
and how increased environmental regulations could overcome them.
Examples of this strand include situations where firms are first movers
within international markets characterized by imperfect competition where
domestic production may increase as a result of more stringent environmental
regulation [@simpsonTaxingVariableCost1996]. Another common market failure
that could lead to the coexistence of the *PH* alongside profit-maximizing firms
are information asymmetries between households and firms.
The main idea here is that by setting industry standards or labels, firms
are able to credibly communicate the environmental benefits of their products
and overcome the asymmetry [@ambecSurvolFondementsTheoriques2007].
Finally, the non-exclusive nature of R&D may lead to spillovers from the
innovating firm to other firms in the industry. This may lead the economy
to be in a bad equilibrium where firms invest too little in environmental
technologies. If this is indeed the case, then regulations can level the playing
field among firms and lead to a move to the higher, more R&D intensive
equilibrium [@mohrTechnicalChangeExternal2002].

On the empirical front, much has been written to reinforce the initially very
theoretical debate surrounding the Porter Hypothesis.
To facilitate its analysis, @jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997
divided the original hypothesis into three distinct ones. What is known as
the "Strong Porter Hypothesis" (*SPH*) links environmental regulation to firm
competitiveness. The "Weak Porter Hypothesis" (*WPH*) links regulation to innovation,
and the "Narrow Porter Hypothesis" argues that flexible market-based
regulations are more effective in generating innovation than stricter
command-and-control policies^[Since we will focus on the former two
two hypotheses, we will not elaborate on the "narrow" hypothesis in this
literature review.].

The empirical literature analyzing the weak version of the Porter Hypothesis
usually operationalizes innovation as R&D expenditures or through
(aggregate or sector specific) patent counts. When instead analysing the
strong version of the *PH* studies usually rely on firm profits.
On the right hand side, the
independent variable, environmental policy stringency, was initially proxied
by pollution abatement costs [@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997] or 
energy prices [@newellInducedInnovationHypothesis1999] before being more
holistically estimated via the use of indicators such as the Environmental Policy Stringency (*EPS*) indicator
developed by the OECD [@kruseMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2022] or national
firm-level surveys such as the Community Innovation Survey^[See
@cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018 for a recent meta-analysis of
the Porter Hypothesis and an outline of the different measures used.] [@eurostatCommunityInnovationSurvey2022].
As we will outline more in detail in section 3 of the paper, we will take
the modern approach and use the EPS index to proxy for environmental regulation
stringency at the domestic level and patent counts and business R&D
expenditures to proxy inventive activity of firms.
The weak version of the Porter Hypothesis is found to be the most consistently
verified hypothesis among the three as outlined in the meta-analysis by @cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018. The authors of the meta-analysis
namely highlight the following points:

- Early studies tend to find a negative relationship between environmental
stringency and innovation/competitiveness. More recent studies find a
positive relationship between the two variables.
- Cross-country studies are more likely to find a positive link than
firm-level studies. One possible reason for this can be found in the fact that 
innovative activity of upstream equipment manufacturers or new entrants may also 
respond to changes in the regulatory frameworks within an industry [@noaillyDirectingTechnicalChange2015; @sanyalProductMarketCompetition2013]^[Furthermore, 
@cohenImpactEnvironmentalRegulation2018 note
that "[t]o the extent that the Porter Hypothesis as originally 
formulated focused on the competitiveness of nations, this finding is of
particular interest [...]". In other words, since the original *PH* focused
on nations as the unit of analysis, it is natural to take this unit of
analysis when empirically testing it.].
- Studies incorporating a temporal lag between the change in regulation
stringency and inventive or profitability outcomes are more likely to
find a positive relationship. This echoes once again the original formulation
of the Porter Hypothesis which states that while regulation may hurt short
term competitiveness and productivity, the long term effects would be positive.

These findings will guide us in the elaboration of a panel model
that will be outlined in more detail in section 3. Let us now turn our
attention to the second strand of literature use to guide our empirical strategy
and examine the impact of policy (un-)certainty on innovation.

## The Role of Policy Certainty on the Innovative Behavior of Firms

While the empirical literature on the impact of policy certainty on innovation
is more
recent and less abundant than the one on the Porter Hypothesis,
a number of papers have investigated it.
The literature of the impact of policy certainty on innovative
activity was derived from the one that links policy uncertainty and investments
in tangible assets. Early theoretical contributions outline that non-reversible
investments are often delayed or scrapped if firms experience regulatory
uncertainty via an increase in the utility derived from the status-quo^[See
@bernankeIrreversibilityUncertaintyCyclical1983 and
@bloomTradeInducedTechnical2016 for respectively a seminal and a
recent theoretical model.].
On the empirical front, @alesinaIncomeDistributionPolitical1996 were the first
to investigate this link with a cross-section analysis of over 70 countries.
More specifically, they find that more unequal countries are more likely to
be politically unstable and political instability in itself has an adverse
effect on investments in tangible assets. Additional empirical evidence
highlighting the negative effect of policy uncertainty was provided by
@bloomUncertaintyInvestmentDynamics2007 who extend the analysis to a panel model,
@julioPoliticalUncertaintyCorporate2012 who highlight a negative impact of being
in an election year on firm investments, and
@gulenPolicyUncertaintyCorporate2016 who leverage the Economic Policy
Uncertainty index developed by @bakerMeasuringEconomicPolicy2016 to
describe a similar effect within a panel analysis.

This negative effect between policy uncertainty and tangible asset
investments need not hold for intangible investments in R&D
since the latter are different and are namely characterized by
a long-term horizon and a fat tailed risk
distribution^[This characteristic is a product of the trial and
error nature of the R&D process where only a small subset of research
endeavors are successful and profitable.]. Nevertheless, a growing game
theoretical literature argues that short-term agreements are less conducive to 
investments in green R&D than long-term agreements due to the comparatively
higher hold-up phenomenon when renegotiations are frequent
[@harstadDynamicsClimateAgreements2016]. This phenomenon is mainly explained by
the fact that countries that are more efficient in mitigating or abating
emissions due to previous investments in the related technology will be asked
to leverage their competitive advantage and bear the brunt of the emission
reduction in negotiations.
@bhattacharyaWhatAffectsInnovation2017 were the
first to investigate the effect of policy uncertainty on innovation outcomes (i.e. 
patent quantities and citations) empirically. They extend the theoretical
model proposed by @edmansBlockholderTradingMarket2009 on managerial myopia
by adding economic uncertainty, a measure of policy state and a measure of
policy uncertainty. Using this theoretical framework, they test whether
the pure effect of country level policy orientation, as proxied by the Database
of Political Institutions, and policy uncertainty, as proxied by
the occurrence of election events, have an impact on firm-level innovation
[@keefer2012database]. Crucially, they are able to show that innovation
is more affected by policy uncertainty than by policy itself. This leads
to the conclusion that a politically stable environment is beneficial to
R&D investments and confirms the findings of the game theoretical literature
[@beccherleRegionalInitiativesCost2011; @harstadDynamicsClimateAgreements2016].

These studies are looking at the aggregate level effect between policy
certainty and innovation.
More recently however, newspaper indices on both climate policy uncertainty
[@gavriilidisMeasuringClimatePolicy2021] and on
climate policy salience became available [@noaillyHeardNewsEnvironmental2021].
These indexes are both built by programmatically analyzing US newspaper
articles over a given period to detect the co-occurrence of a given set of
words^[Both follow the methodology outlined in the Economic Policy
Uncertainty index developed by @bakerMeasuringEconomicPolicy2016 and apply
different keywords to the programmatic analysis of US newspapers.].
@gavriilidisMeasuringClimatePolicy2021 used his index to show that
increased policy uncertainty lead to a reduction of CO2 emissions.
He further argues that, this might be due to either a decrease in energy
consumption and a reduction in non-essential transport or an increase in
the demand for renewable energy consumption and an associated increase in
climate-friendly innovations.
On the other hand@noailly2021heard were able to leverage their policy salience
index to
demonstrate a positive link between policy salience and the probability
of cleantech startups receiving venture capital funding.
While these indices are able to inform research on the link between
environmental policy uncertainty/salience and innovative inputs and outcomes
for the US, they cannot yet be used within a panel framework. Furthermore,
these indices are symptomatic in that they capture perceptions of an aggregate
policy environment. As both papers outline the aggregate sentiment as proxied
by newspaper articles, they do not consider the root causes of this uncertainty
or salience.

This underlines the importance of considering the potential variables which 
influence domestic
environmental policy certainty and may reinforce innovative activity.
This leads us to hypothesis that international commitments, in the form of the 
the participation in international environmental agreements, may reinforce
the credibility of domestic environmental policy and thus increase the effect
of environmental policy stringency on innovation. We will refer to this effect
as the *indirect effect* of international environmental governance on
environmental innovation. The complementary *direct effects* of international
environmental policy have been outlined in comparative studies within the 
international relations and political science literatures and will analyzed in
more detail in the next subsection. 

## Assessing the Formation and the Effectiveness of International Environmental Governance

While the literature on global environmental governance
does not specifically address the link between the participation rate of a 
country
in the international governance complex and the rate of innovation
of its firms, it offers insights in two main ways. First, an important strand
investigates the drivers motivating countries in participating in
international environmental treaties. A second complementary strand  
explores the effect of international proximity and cooperation on
environmental performance. We will analyse each
strand in turn and focus on deriving the *direct effects* between the 
embeddedness of a country in the international environmental governance network
and the innovation process to motivate our theoretical approach presented in 
the next chapter. The first strand of this literature leverages game 
theoretical or social network analysis methodologies 
to understand the formation of cooperative ties in the environmental governance 
network. The latter methodologies are of a particular relevance in our case
since they acknowledge the interdependence of the cooperative tie formation 
process.

The initial methodological lens through which international environmental
cooperation has been assessed is game theory. The main unit of analysis in early
papers was often a single agreement such as the Montreal Protocol 
[@barrettSelfEnforcingInternationalEnvironmental1994]. More recent theoretical
advances in the literature consider the participation in IEAs as a static or a 
dynamic game with repeated interactions between countries 
[beccherleRegionalInitiativesCost2011; harstadDynamicsClimateAgreements2016;
@battagliniParticipationDurationEnvironmental2016].^[The majority of the
empirical evidence within the game theoretic literature comes from experimental
economics. See e.g. @tavoniInequalityCommunicationAvoidance2011 and 
@barrettClimateNegotiationsScientific2012]
The main conclusion of this strand that is of a particular interest to us is
that long term agreements create a more certain policy environment and help
reduce the uncertainty that surrounds investment in green R&D.
However, although dynamic in nature,
the aim of these models is to devise the characteristics of an effective
prototypical international environmental agreement. In other words, it does
not consider the emergence of a *international environmental governance network*.
This underlines the necessity of adopting a polycentric approach in
the analysis of the *network* of environmental governance where agents interact
at different levels [@ostromPolycentricApproachCoping2009;
@jordanGoverningClimateChange2018] in a dynamic context. Social network analysis
methods have thus been employed to understand the drivers of international
cooperation within such a framework. The main benefits of using
such an approach to analyse the emergence of cooperative ties is that these
depend on both the *characteristics* of the agents that form them and the
*structure* of the network they exist in. @kinneNetworkDynamicsEvolution2013
underlined that states are more likely to form bilateral cooperation ties if
they share agreements with third parties^[This confirms
the triadic closure phenomenon highlighted by Granovetter 
@granovetterStrengthWeakTies1973].], if they sign more agreements overall, and
if they exhibit similar characteristics with their bilateral partners. While
Kinne examines a unimodal network of bilateral agreements between the end of the
Second World War and 1980 due to data availability,
@hollwayMultilevelEmbeddednessCase2016 further his analysis by examining the
bipartite structure of network and highlight the importance of multilateral
agreements in the process of triadic closure.
While this first strand of the literature on the formation of environmental
cooperation does not have a direct impact on the rates of innovation of countries,
it is useful to understand the relevance of social network analysis
as a mean to study the concurrent effects of the position of an agent in a network
and their characteristics as opposed to the previously discussed game theoretical
approach. Moving forward, we will therefore see the environmental governance
complex as a network and highlight the effects of the topological attributes of
countries on innovative inputs and outcomes.

The second strand of the literature on environmental governance
grew from the fact that domestic
policy is affected by *both* domestic and international factors
[@dreznerAllPoliticsGlobal2008; @haysGlobalizationNewPolitics2009; @jahnPoliticsEnvironmentalPerformance2016].
As such, it investigates the *effects* of
international environmental cooperation on country level variables such as
environmental performance and innovation. This specific strand is surprisingly
understudied and most evidence presented below either theoretical or
qualitative. To our knowledge, the only attempt to investigate the link
between the intensity of participation in the environmental governance complex 
quantitatively was provided by @jahnPoliticsEnvironmentalPerformance2016 and
is discussed below, after underlining a number of qualitative stylized facts
on environmental cooperation.

The Stern review provides initial theoretical and qualitative insights into the
ways increased international cooperation may facilitate eco-innovation
(@sternEconomicsClimateChange2007, chapters 16 & 24). The main lens the review
considers the link between international cooperation is one of portfolio
management where cooperation is motivated by knowledge sharing^[To
namely overcome the developed/developing divide and ensure a fair
transition for developing countries where climate targets are met but not at
the expense of the growth of developing countries.], efficiency gains
through the coordination of R&D portfolios and finally the pooling of
risks which are a characteristic of the innovation process. In addition
to this portfolio approach, they underline the importance of setting
of international environmental standards which may reinforce domestic 
environmental regulation (@sternEconomicsClimateChange2007, chapter 24.6).
In other words, Stern argues that international co-ordination on performance
standards leads to larger markets being affected than if countries were to
act in isolation which may lead the market to tip from one equilibirium to
another due to a combination of network feedback effects, economies of
scale or technological lock-in effects
(See @barrettIncreasingParticipationCompliance2003 for a discussion).
These qualitative insights on R&D cooperation and international standard setting
are not the only channels in which international environmental policy may affect
innovation and environmental performance as we have outlined above in the
previous subsection. 

@jahnPoliticsEnvironmentalPerformance2016 complements these insights with
an analysis of the effect of supra-national factors such as the
membership in international organizations, the membership in international
treaties as well as more general effects such as globalization on multiple
indices of environmental
performance of OECD countries he constructed^[Other comparative analyses
complement his findings: see e.g. @holzingerEnvironmentalPolicyConvergence2008
and @bauer2014conceptual.].
While Jahn's dependent variable is environmental performance, his central
argument on the relevance of the *combination* of both national an
international policy factors is nevertheless valuable
in the context of this study as it highlights the rise of international
environmental policymaking. The rising importance of international environmental
cooperation has further been highlighted by @carattiniWhatDoesNetwork2021
who illustrate it by using a network analysis approach to analyse the ECOLEX
dataset[@unepiucnfaoECOLEXGatewayEnvironmental2022]. The aim of their paper
is to derive a set of stylized facts on the intertemporal evolution of
the network of international agreements by constructing a "cooperation network"
between states.^[Section 3 provides the reader with more detail about the
construction of such a cooperation network and in particular the theoretical
implications associated with such a measure.] After constructing this cooperation
network, Carattini et. al describe the evolution of the position of states within
this network. They narrow down their observations to the following four stylized
facts:

1. "Meaningful environmental cooperation emerged in the late 1970's."
1. "Environmental cooperation has become closer, denser and more cohesive."
1. "The environmental cooperation network, while global has a noticeable European
imprint."
1. International environmental cooperation started with fisheries agreements
but the contemporary focus has shifted towards the management of waste and
hazardous substances.

These stylized facts empirically confirm observations from the theoretical
literature on international environmental agreements that highlight their
growing importance [@jordanGoverningClimateChange2018; @ostromPolycentricApproachCoping2009]. 

In conjunction with the literature on policy certainty shown in the previous section,
the increased importance of international environmental politics leads us
to draw a model that investigates the concurrent effects of national and international
environmental policies on the innovative behavior of firms. The aim of our
paper is therefore to investigate whether or not the relative
position^[In a topological sense.] of a country
in the global environmental governance network affects the different versions
of the Porter Hypothesis. Now that the theoretical motivation of our study is
set, let us outline our empirical strategy in the methodology section.

# Methodology and Data {#methodsdata}

This section will outline the computation of a novel set of centrality measures
which will be used in the subsequent analysis to proxy the relative importance
of countries within the international environmental governance complex and
account for the increasing importance of international policy to tackle
environmental challenges. In what follows, we will describe the construction
of the bipartite membership network of international agreements^[Note that we
interchangeably use bimodal and bipartite as adjectives to qualify the nature
of the original membership network. The original network is both bimodal,
since it has two different types of agreements, and bipartite since it does
not have links between two nodes of the same type.
[@borgatti20092]] and the
extraction of a monopartite cooperation network which defines links between countries
as the number of agreements that have been signed in common. We then
statistically validate this projection by comparing the resulting observed
one cooperation network with a null model. This process is also commonly
known as *backbone extraction*. Finally, we describe the computation of
two centrality indices that will proxy the intensity and the certainty of
international policy as well as all other variables of interest.
Let us however start by defining the empirical panel model that
we will estimate in the next section before detailing the construction of
its various coefficients.

## The Empirical Model:

We define the following general panel model and consider
all OECD countries over the time period between 1990 and 2015.

$$
y_{it} = \beta_1 \text{EPS}_{i,\ t-k} + \beta_2 \text{Strength}_{i,\ t-k}^{M} +
\beta_3 \text{Transitivity}_{i,\ t-k}^{M} + \beta_4 X_{it} + \alpha_i + \delta_t + u_{it}
$$

Where $\text{EPS}_{i,\ t-k}$ is a proxy for national environmental policy
stringency over the time period between 1990 and 2015 for OECD countries.
$\text{Strength}_{it}^{M}$ and $\text{Transitivity}_{it}^{M}$ are indexes characterizing
the international policy network on the environment we compute by using
different *backbone extraction* methods $M$ to ensure the robustness of our
results. $X_{it}$ is a vector of control variables including GDP per capita
measures from the World Bank and import/export intensity measures to account
for the economic integration in the global trade network. Finally, we add
both country $\alpha_i$ and 

We will begin by defining the construction of the  $\text{Strength}_{it}$ and the
$\text{Transitivity}_{it}$ measures of international governance before turning
to the $\text{EPS}_{it}$ indicator and the various dependent variables of
innovation and productivity we use to test the different versions of Porter's
Hypothesis.

## Constructing international environmental cooperation centrality measures:

We leverage the ECOLEX dataset to construct country level measures of
embeddedness in the international environmental cooperation network
[@unepiucnfaoECOLEXGatewayEnvironmental2022]^[To be more specific, we use a 
scraped version included in the `{manyenviron}` package 
[@hollwayManyenvironEnvironmentalAgreements2021] which was originally used in
@sommerGlobalGovernanceForestry2020]. This dataset lists
environmental agreements between two or more parties and the related
membership actions over the period between 1868 and 2018 and contains over
25000 individual membership actions.^[See Table \@ref(tab:ECOLEX) describing
the structure of the dataset and displaying the first few observations.]
We follow @carattiniWhatDoesNetwork2021
and retain agreements that were signed in the Post-war period starting in
1948. We retain 21270 individual membership actions after filtering out
agreements signed before 1948. After further cleaning the data by excluding
observations on which we do not have identifying information such as the date of
the ratification of the agreement and the date of entry into force or the
country which is the subject of the membership action, we retain 18878
individual membership actions that describe 521 individual international
environmental agreements.

### From a Bipartite Membership Network:

The ECOLEX dataset presented above in \@ref(tab:ECOLEX) can be visualized as
an annual series of undirected, unweighted, bipartite/bimodal networks.
This can be done in the form of a yearly incidence matrix $I_{C \times A}^t$ where each row
corresponds to a country (an agent) and each column to a treaty (an artifact)
[@latapyBasicNotionsAnalysis2008]. The main theoretical difference between the
two sets of nodes is that the former has agency over the links while the latter
does not.^[This distinction will inform the choice of the backbone extraction
algorithm as outlined below.] $i_{ik}^t$ equals $1$
if country $i$ has ratified agreement $k$ which entered into force during or before year
$t$ and $0$ otherwise. A country can only be a member of a treaty once which implies
that $i_{ik}^t \in \{0,1\}$.

```{=latex}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{rcases}\displaystyle
    I_{ik}^t = \overbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    i_{1,1}     & i_{1,2}     & i_{1,3}     & \dots     & i_{1,A}           \\
    i_{2,1}     & i_{2,2}     & i_{2,3}     & \dots     & i_{2,A}           \\
    i_{3,1}     & i_{3,2}     & i_{3,3}     & \dots     & i_{3,A}           \\
    \vdots      & \vdots      & \vdots      & \ddots    & \vdots      \\
    i_{C,1}     & i_{C,2}     & i_{C,3}     & \dots     & i_{C,A}
  \end{pmatrix}}^{\text{Agreements}}
  \end{rcases}
    \text{Countries}
\end{equation*}
```

We can also visualize the bipartite/bimodal membership network directly and
distinguish agreements from countries.
The network is depicted in \@ref(fig:ECOLEX_bipartite_network)
represents the membership network with all agreements that entered into force
respectively during the period of 1948 and 1978 and 1948 and 2018. This shows
that the network grew denser as agreements were signed, ratified and entered
into force over time. To explore the intertemporal evolution of
the structure of the network, we will divide this network and construct
yearly snapshots of the membership graph whose incidence matrix we define as
$I_{C \times A}^t$ which is one of the two standard methods used in social network
analysis to account for the intertemporal evolution of a network
[@everettDualprojectionApproachTwomode2013].

### To a Monopartite Cooperation Network:

While we could further analyze this
network directly, we will transform it into a more easily interpretable
one mode network by using a projection and retaining only significant edges
through a backbone extraction algorithm. We will thus broadly follow
@carattiniWhatDoesNetwork2021 while ensuring that our results are not contingent
on the backbone extraction algorithm since the theoretical underpinnings of
the latter are still somewhat unclear in empirical social network analysis
[@nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021].

We begin by creating a naive projection of the membership network. To perform
this naive projection we multiply the yearly incidence matrix $I_{c \times a}^t$
defined above by its transposed $I_{A \times C}^t$ as follows:

$$
I_{C \times A}^t I_{A \times C}^t = Adj_{C\times C}^t
$$
Where $Adj_{c\times c}^t$ is the adjacency matrix of the projected cooperation network in
which $Adj_{ij}^t$ is the number of observed co-signed agreements between the two countries
that entered into force in the interval $[1948; t]$. These weights capture
the intensity of the environmental cooperation between two countries much like
@newmanScientificCollaborationNetworks2001 captured collaboration within a
bipartite network of scientific collaboration. Concurrently,
it implies that bilateral treaties, ceteris paribus, carry a greater weight
in the cooperation network than multilateral treaties. This is consistent with
the heterogeneous role both play within the environmental governance network.
As highlighted by @hollwayMultilevelEmbeddednessCase2016, bilateral treaties
are akin to contracts between two parties while multilateral treaties serve
"normative [...] law-making tools". While both types may act as policy stringency
signals, bilateral treaties carry more weight through their specific contractual nature
hence developing a greater policy stringency signal for firms. 

We cannot, however, directly analyze this cooperation network as the resulting
*naive* monopartite network, depicted in the first panel of
\@ref(fig:ECOLEX_monopartite), still suffers from two issues. First, nodes
with larger degrees in the original bipartite membership network
(e.g. agreements with a larger number signatories or
countries having signed a larger number of agreements) will bear stronger
edges in the projected network. In other words,
if *country A* and *country B* are bound by the same 5 agreements and have
each signed 5 agreements in total, they are conceptually "closer" than
*country C* and *country D* who share the membership in 10 agreements but
have each signed a total of 50 agreements
[@borgatti2011analyzing; @latapyBasicNotionsAnalysis2008;
@nealBackboneBipartiteProjections2014;
@saraccoInferringMonopartiteProjections2017]. However in the resulting one-mode
projection, the latter will be weighted more than the former.
The second issue relates to the fact that *naive* projections may lead to the
emergence of spurious cliques in the projection that are due to a node with a
single connection to the opposite layer in the original bipartite network 
[@saraccoInferringMonopartiteProjections2017]. To solve these two common issues,
we leverage what is known as a backbone extraction algorithm to retain only the
statistically significant edges from the naive projection e.g. the edges
that appear more frequently in the projection than expected by a given null
model.

### Correcting the Monopartite Cooperation Network:

We will use the following three distinct backbone extraction methods to ensure
that our results are not the product of the choice of a particular extraction
method alone. This is especially crucial since we do not have a "ground truth"
or a counterfactual monoparite cooperation network to compare the corrected
projection to. All three considered algorithms follow the same process in that they
impose a constraint $M$ on the original bipartite
network and reshuffle the values of the incidence matrix $I_{C \times A}$.^[We
broadly follow the notation used in @nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021
where each backbone extraction method is described in more detail.
Furthermore, we abstract from superscript $t$ to indicate the time period of the network as
we apply the backbone extraction method to each temporal snapshot of the network.]
In other words, we consider the set of all possible permutations of the original
incidence matrix $I_{c \times a}^t$ containing the same countries and treaties
and satisfying the constraint $M$. We call this set $\mathcal{I}^M$
which is consists of the individual permutated matrices $I^*$. The algorithm
then constructs the one-mode projection of $I^*$ as follows: $P^* = I^*\times [I^*]^T$
Recall that when performing the naive projection, we defined $p_{ij}$ as the observed
number of co-signed treaties between country $i$ and country $j$.
To decide whether an edge between $i$ and $j$ should be included in the
backbone of the projected network, the algorithm compares the observed value $p_{ij}^t$
to the simulated one in $P^*$ which we call $p_{ij}^*$. We therefore define
the following two-sided hypothesis test to characterize the presence (or absence)
of a tie $p_{i j}^{B}$ in the backbone $P^B$ based on a significance level $\alpha$.

$$
p_{i j}^{B}=
\begin{cases}1 & \text { if } \operatorname{Pr}\left(p_{i j}^{*} \geq p_{i j}\right)<\frac{\alpha}{2} \\
0 & \text { else }\end{cases}
$$

As described in @nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021, we use a two-tailed test
since we would like to filter out both uncommonly small *and* uncommonly large
collaborative ties in the projection. @nealBackbonePackageExtract2022 point
out that since we perform this hypothesis test for every non-null edge, we
will inflate the Type-I error i.e. include too many false positives in our
corrected graph. ^[The significance level $\alpha$ defines the probability
that a given edge is included in the backbone. Since we run this test over
$e$ edges, the probability that we detect at least one such false positive across our
test equals $1-(1-\alpha)^e$ which is strictly increasing in the number of tests
$e$.] Following @nealBackbonePackageExtract2022, we therefore leverage the
False Discovery Rate multiple test correction
method which sorts the observed p-values in an increasing order before retaining
all edges with a p-value satisfying $\text{P-value}_{d}\leq \frac{d}{m} \alpha$
where $d \in \{1,\dots, e\}$ for all backbone extraction methods
[@benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995].

Finally, this hypothesis test yields a binary correction
matrix which informs us whether to keep a tie in the naive projection or not and
thereby solves both issues of the naive projection described above.
Now that we have a general understanding of the process
of a backbone extraction algorithm, we turn to the following three subsections
which will focus on the differences between the
different algorithms that lie in the nature of the constraint they
impose on the simulated networks. We will thus consider in turn the
Fixed Row Model, the Fixed Degree Sequence Model, and the Stochastic Degree
Sequence Model.

#### Fixed Degree Sequence Model:

The Fixed Degree Sequence Model (FDSM) is a microcanonical backbone extraction
method in that the constraint that it imposes on the set of possible permutations
$\mathcal{I}^{FDSM}$ is satisfied *exactly*.^[This stands in opposition to
canonical extraction algorithm that impose the constraint only *on average*.]
More specifically, the FDSM algorithm sets the degrees of each agent and
each artifact to be equal to the degree sequences of the observed network.
In our context, it implies that the row and column sums of the simulated $I_{ik}^*$
are to be equal to those of the observed network $I_{ik}$ under the FDSM algorithm. 

$$
  I_{ik}^* = 
\begin{blockarray}{cccccc}
\begin{block}{(ccccc)c}
  1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & 1 & \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{1k} \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 1 & \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{2k} \\
  0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 1 & \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{3k} \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 1 & \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{4k} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
  0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 1 & \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{Ck} \\
\end{block}
\sum_{i = 1}^{C} i_{i1} & \sum_{i = 1}^{C} i_{i2} & \sum_{i = 1}^{C} i_{i3} & \dots & \sum_{i = 1}^{C} i_{iA} \\
\end{blockarray}
$$

As @nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021 point out, the main advantage of this
method is that it is able to alleviate the two issues plaguing our *naive projection* outlined
above by controlling for the vector of degrees. Intuitively,
we retain the cooperative edges that occur more often than expected by the
null model in the observed projection.^[@vasquesfilhoTransitivityDegreeAssortativity2020,
degree sequences of the bipartite
network are chiefly responsive for the structure of its monopartite projection.]
The main disadvantage of such an algorithm is that it is ill suited for large
bipartite networks due the computational complexity of the algorithm
[@nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021]. A set of alternative models has been developed
to alleviate this computational issue, among which are the Fixed Row Model
and the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model which we define below.

#### Fixed Row Model:

Like the FDSM, the Fixed Row Model (FRM) is also a microcanonical algorithm.
However, the main difference is that it imposes the degree sequence constraint
on the row sums of the incidence matrix only.^[E.g.
$$
\forall_{i \in \{1,...,C\}} \sum_{k = 1}^{A} i_{ik} = \forall_{i \in \{1,...,C\}} \sum_{k = 1}^{A} 
i_{ik}^*
$$
]
^[The FRM model is also sometimes referred to as the hypergeometric
model [@tumminelloStatisticallyValidatedNetworks2011].]
That is, the degree of every *agent*/country is strictly controlled for, which
implies that in all simulated networks, a country will be bound by the same
number of agreements than in the observed network. However, an agreement
is free to have a different number of total signatories. This leads us to the
reason why we are not considering the Fixed Column Model: agency. Recall that
we previously defined two distinct sets of nodes depending on whether or not
the nodes posses agency over the links they would like to create or dissolve.
Since agreements do not have agency and are constructed through the will
of countries, we constrain the latter's degree only.
@carattiniWhatDoesNetwork2021 applied the Bipartite Partial Configuration Model
which is the canonical version of the FRM algorithm, to their membership network
[@saraccoInferringMonopartiteProjections2017].
This implies that the restriction imposed on the degree sequence of countries
is only satisfied *on average* over all simulations.
Since our membership network is small enough to
be corrected by applying the more computationally intensive FRM algorithm, we
follow the latter as it carries more information about the structure of the
original bipartite network than the BiPCM algorithm
[@saraccoInferringMonopartiteProjections2017].

#### Stochastic Degree Sequence Model:

The Stochastic Degree Sequence Model (SDSM) is a canonical algorithm that
imposes a constraint on both the degree sequence of countries and on the
degree sequence of agreements like the FDSM extraction method. However,
the set of simulated networks satisfy this constraint only *on average*.
In our case, this implies that the average number of member countries
in a given international agreement $k$ in the set of simulated networks is equal
to the number of countries in the observed membership network. Conversely,
it also implies that the average number of agreements signed by a given country
$i$ in the set of simulated networks is equal to the average number of agreements
signed by country $i$ in the observed network. Several methods exist to
simulate networks satisfying this constraint which are compared in terms of
accuracy and computational speed in @nealComparingAlternativesFixed2021.
The authors show that the Bipartite Configuration Model (BICM) is both the
fastest and most accurate method to generate simulated network satisfying
the average condition [@saraccoInferringMonopartiteProjections2017]. We thus
leverage it as our third and last backbone extraction model.

#### Comparing the Projections:

Before moving on to the definition of the various centrality measures we
will use to measure the level of international embeddedness of countries
within the network of international environmental agreements, we will compare
the resulting corrected projections. We namely see that the correction
of performed by the FROW backbone extraction process retains about 90 percent of the
edges of the naive projection which leads to an overly dense network. We
will therefore not consider it in the further analysis as it does not solve
the two issues which we try to correct. This is consistent with Carattini et al.
who mention that their BiPCM-corrected cooperation network's density is so high that
almost every node is connected to each other [@carattiniWhatDoesNetwork2021].
On the other hand, both the
SDSM and the FDSM retain on average about 15 percent of the most significant
edges present in the naive projection. This ensures that we capture the true
cooperative network and not a statistical artifact caused by the two issues
we are trying to correct for. We will therefore compute the centrality scores
on the basis of the latter two corrected networks.

### Selecting and Computing Network Centrality Measures:

Now that we constructed and corrected the monopartite cooperation networks,
we can characterize the topological position of a given country within the
network and construct proxies for the *embeddedness* of a country in the
international environmental governance complex. While there exist a multitude
of centrality indices to characterize the position of a country
and no unifying theoretical framework for defining it, we will
consider the commonly used strength centrality measure and the
eigenvector centrality measure which we will theoretically justify in turn.

#### Strength Centrality:

The strength of a node in an undirected and unweighted network measures the
number of ties emanating from a node and weights them by their respective
weights as follows:

$$
s_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{i j} w_{i j}
$$
Strength centrality echoes the proxy @jahnPoliticsEnvironmentalPerformance2016
used to measure embeddedness in the
international governance complex in that it captures the sum of
cooperative ties of a given country within the weighted network of ties. Hence
we expect that a country with a higher level of strength, ceteris paribus,
will be more embedded in the international environmental agreement network.
As stated in the previous chapter, we expect that this increased embeddedness
leads to an increase in environmental innovation through both direct effects
of the international policy framework and the indirect effects of a greater
policy certainty. While we cannot distinguish both channels in this study,
we expect that the node strength captures a relatively greater share of 
the direct effects of the increased embeddedness on innovation as
it measures the quantity of agreement a country is bound by. The opposite
can be said of the eigenvector centrality measure we define below.

#### Transitivity:

The weighted clustering coefficient extends the notion of embeddedness by
computing the weighted proportion of triangles over connected triples
that are centered on a given node [@barratArchitectureComplexWeighted2004].
On the illustration below, we see that
the figure on the right is an open triple from the point of view of the orange
node but not a triangle as opposed to the figure on the right. If we abstract
from the weights, it is easy to see that the clustering coefficient,
also known as transitivity, of the orange node on the left figure is
equal to 1 while the transitivity of the orange node on the right hand side figure
is 0.

```{r transitivitygraph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Transitivity"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Transitivity.png")
```

Mathematically, @barratArchitectureComplexWeighted2004 define the weighted index as follows
where $w_{i j}$ is the weight of the link between node $i$ and node $j$,
$a_{ij}$ is a binary variable indicating the presence of an edge between $i$ and $j$,
$s_i$ is the strength of node $i$, and $k_i$ is the node's degree.

$$
c_{i}^{w}=\frac{1}{s_{i}\left(k_{i}-1\right)} \sum_{j, h} \frac{\left(w_{i j}+w_{i h}\right)}{2} a_{i j} a_{i h} a_{j h} \in [0;1]
$$

In our international cooperation network, we can interpret this coefficient
as the local empirical reflection of closure which is a characteristic of
a network where agents have a low level of information asymmetry with regards
of the actions undertaken by each node over time [@colemanSocialCapitalCreation1988].
This facilitated monitoring favors the application of sanctions if an agent defects
as well as the emergence of a virtuous cycle of trust and further cooperation
[@burtNetworkStructureSocial2000].
This virtuous cycle echoes both arguments in sociology by
@granovetterEconomicActionSocial1985 who posits that the cost of breaking a
friends trust and therefore the friendship is greater when both agents have a
friend in common since the betrayal may also affect one's relationship with the
latter. This argument has been made concurrently in the field of economics and
especially within the game theoretical analysis of repeated games
[@tullockAdamSmithPrisoners1985] and within the empirical analysis of
reputation in medieval trading [@greifReputationCoalitionsMedieval1989].
The main insight in our case of international cooperation is therefore
that countries with a higher transitivity index will have a higher cost of
defecting. This in turn leads to a higher level of trust within the network,
and crucially in our case, a higher level of economic policy certainty which
we hypothesize is favorable to the process of green innovation.

## Other variables:

### Environmental Policy Stringency Index:

The Environmental Policy Stringency Index (EPS) is an index created by the OECD
which measures the stringency of environmental policy at the country level
during the period of 1990 to 2015 [@bottaMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2014].
As pointed out in the literature on environmental policy and innovation by
@poppEnvironmentalPolicyInnovation2019, the  
index is often used as an empirical proxy to measure environmental policy in
the literature including in studies examining Porter's Hypothesis
[@galeottiMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2020;
@martinez-zarzosoDoesEnvironmentalPolicy2019]. While we refer the reader
to the original paper by @bottaMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2014 for a detailed
description of the construction of the index, we can summarize it as follows.
The basis of the EPS index are individual indices of policy stringency such
as emission taxes, trading schemes, environmental standards, and governmental
R&D subsidies. These individual policy categories are then given a ranking
on a Lickert scale between 0 and 6 before being aggregated into market and
non-market based policies. These two subsets are then once again equally
aggregated into the composite EPS index with equal weights which provides us
with a reliable country level measure of aggregate domestic environmental policy.
Overall, one can discern a positive trend in the stringency level over the
considered period for every country indicating the implementation of more
stringent environmental policies.

  ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Country")) +
  ggplot2::labs(caption = "OECD, 2015") +
  iheiddown::theme_iheid()
```

### Innovation Measures:

We measure innovation, the first of our dependent variables, in two main ways. 
First, we consider the Business Expenditures on R&D (BERD) to capture the input 
side of the innovation process by using data from the OECD 
[@oecdMainScienceTechnology2022]. We complement the insight from this analysis
by using Triadic Patent Family (TFP) counts and Environmental Patent (EnvPat) 
counts to proxy *the outcome* of the research process
[@oecdOECDTriadicPatent2022; @oecdPatentsEnvironmentTechnologies2022].
Both insights are complementary as Business Expenditures on R&D 
give a good approximation of the importance placed on the R&D process by firms 
while Triadic Family Patent counts and the country-level share of environmental
patents allows us to examine the effect of environmental policy on *outcomes*
of inventive activity @poppEnvironmentalPolicyInnovation2019. In conclusion,
these innovation proxies will allow us to assess the *Weak Porter Hypothesis*.

#### Business Expenditures in R&D:

We see an overall upward trend in the logged BERD indicating an increase
of the level of expenditures on R&D across all countries. In addition,
we note a considerable country-level heterogeneity with the top 3 countries
being the United States, Japan and Germany.

```{r BERDdesc, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Business Expenditures in R\\&D 1990-2015", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS(paste0(clean_data_path, "Panel.rds")) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = log(berd))) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(color = Country), size = 0.6) +
  ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Country")) +
  ggplot2::labs(caption = "OECD, 2022",
                y = "log(BERD)") +
  iheiddown::theme_iheid()
```

#### Triadic Family Patent Counts:

Triadic Family Patent counts show a similar pattern with respect to the country
level heterogeneity. The top three countries are once again Japan, the United
States and Germany. Note that while some countries, such as Japan and the US
saw a marked increase in the yearly patent counts, most countries' counts
remained relatively constant over time.

```{r TPFdesc, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Triadic Patent Counts 1990-2015", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS(paste0(clean_data_path, "Panel.rds")) %>%
                     ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = triadic_patent)) +
                     ggplot2::geom_line(aes(color = Country), size = 0.6) +
                     ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Country")) +
                     ggplot2::labs(caption = "OECD, 2022",
                                   y = "Triadic Patent Count") +
                     iheiddown::theme_iheid()
```

#### Environmental Patent Counts:

Taking into account the share of *environmental* patents with respect to
total patents allows us to refine our analysis by matching environmental
policy to environmental patents. This link is key since environmental innovative
activity should arguably be more strongly affected by environmental policy
than other technologies. Using such an alternative estimation allows us
to somewhat shield us from p-hacking claims as they are laid out by
@brunsFlexibilitySelectionPatent2020 in the case of solar energy policies and 
patents.

```{r EnvPatdesc, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Environmental Patent Share 1990-2015", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS(paste0(clean_data_path, "Panel.rds")) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = EnvPatShare)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(color = Country)) +
  ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Country")) +
  ggplot2::labs(caption = "OECD, 2022",
                y = "Environmental Patent Share %") +
  iheiddown::theme_iheid()
```

### Total Factor Productivity:

The *Strong Porter Hypothesis* we laid out in the previous chapter links
environmental policy stringency and productivity or profits. We test this
hypothesis by regressing total factor productivity on the dependent domestic
and international policy variables. To that effect, we will use the
Total Factor Productivity index developed by the Vienna Institute
for International Economic Studies [@stehrerWiiwGrowthProductivity2022].
We will follow @martinez-zarzosoDoesEnvironmentalPolicy2019 and use the
"TFP0" decomposition of GDP based on capital stocks and hours worked only
as defined below. Note that we use TFP growth rates instead of levels in this
instance.

$$
\Delta \ln Y=\Delta \ln T F P 0+\bar{s}_{C} \Delta \ln K+\bar{s}_{L} \Delta \ln H
$$

Two features are sailient from the graph below. First and foremost, we observe
a form of growth rate convergence among OECD countries over the considered time
period around $0\%$ to $2.5\%$ . A second prominent feature is the impact of
the 2008 financial crisis which hit Greece particularly hard.

```{r TFP0desc, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Total Factor Productivity 1990-2015", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
readRDS(paste0(clean_data_path, "Panel.rds")) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = TFP0)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(color = Country), size = 0.6) +
  ggplot2::guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Country")) +
  ggplot2::labs(caption = "EU KLEMS, 2022",
                y = "Total Factor Productivity\n(growth rate %)") +
  ggplot2::xlim(1995, 2015) +
  iheiddown::theme_iheid()
```


## Correlations:

Before moving on to the results, let us consider the correlations between
our variables of interest. The first four columns in of the correlogram
\@ref(fig:correlations) correspond to the correlations between the four
dependent variables and the domestic and international policy variables.
We examine the correlations of different lags and different specifications
of the independent policy variables to ensure that our results are consistent
across all specifications. We namely see that the business expenditure variable
on R&D is positively correlated with all policy variables, both domestic and
international as well as across lags and FDSM/SDSM specifications. Concurringly,
the other innovation outcome proxies, Triadic Family Patent counts and the share
of environmental patents, are also positively correlated with all policy measures.
This evidence therefore seems to confirm the *Weak Porter Hypothesis*. On the other
hand we see that the growth rate of total factor productivity (*TFP0*) seems to be
weakly negatively correlated to our policy measures which indicates that
the *Strong Porter Hypothesis* may not be verified in our case. Let us now
move to the estimation of the empirical model defined in the beginning of this
section in the next chapter to further investigate these correlations.

# Results and Discussion {#results}

In this section, we will estimate the empirical model defined in the previous
section across its multiple specifications while accounting for the backbone
extraction method used. We start by presenting the results from the Stochastic
Degree Sequence Model (SDSM) and discussing each Porter Hypothesis in turn
before complementing the analysis with the network measures computed on the
more stringent Fixed Degree Sequence Model to confirm our results. Furthermore,
we will conduct various robustness checks before discussing the results and
their policy implications.
