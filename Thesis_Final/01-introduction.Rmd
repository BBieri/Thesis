# Introduction {#intro}

Some random fact about why my paper is important given environmental context today

Porter hypothesis is still contested and has neglected the incresed rate 
of international environmental cooperation

Present main findings

In section 2, we review the existing literature on Porter's Hypothesis and
the effect of policy certainty on innovation, and the emerging literature
on the network analysis of the global environmental governance complex. In
section 3, we define the computation of the two environmental governance
network metrics that will proxy the effect of international policymaking
on innovation. Furthermore, we will define our empirical strategy and
provide the reader with descriptive statistics of the main variables of interest.
In section 4, we present and discuss the results stemming from our empirical
estimation. Finally, we wrap up in section 5 and provide pathways for
further research in this up-and-coming field.
