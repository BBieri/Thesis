# Litterature Review {#litreview}

The present paper draws from three distinct but complementary strands of
the literature on environmental policy. First and foremost, we ought to
characterize what is known in the literature as the *Porter Hypothesis* and
distinguish the different versions that have been devised over the years.
We will thus strive to understand the impact of increased environmental regulations
on both innovative activity of firms and on overall firm performance before
completing the analysis by highlighting works that looked at the impact of the
nature of environmental policy on firm-level innovation.
The next strand of the literature relates to the concept of *policy certainty*
which highlights the importance of designing policies that 
Finally, and most central to our contribution, lies the
literature on *International Environmental Governance* and the related methodological
advances to understand it within a network framework.

## The Porter Hypothesis

Over three decades ago, the Porter Hypothesis (PH) challenged the conventional
Panglossian economic thinking that enhanced environmental regulation would
lead to a decrease in economic performance of firms due to the increased
constraints imposed on the firm [@michael1991america]. The main intuition behind the
Panglossian doxa is that if it were profitable for firms to follow a more
sustainable production path, they would do so in the absence of regulations.
On the basis of case studies, Porter however argues that well designed,
market-based, pollution preventing policies would lead firms to create products
that are more resource efficient and thus competitive on the international
market. An example of the latter could be the implementation of more stringent
fuel consumption standards for cars. Porter thus advances that this
increase in environmental stringency, would force domestic automobile
companies to make more fuel efficient cars which in turn would increase
the competitiveness of domestic cars in the world market. 

Porter and Von der Linde later formalize his initial criticism in 
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 where they outline six main
causal links between increased environmental regulations and innovation or
firm performance. First, they contend that "regulation signals companies about
likely resource inefficiencies and potential technological improvements.
Second, they argue that "regulation focused on information gathering
can achieve major benefits [in terms of environmental performance and
economic performance] by raising corporate awareness". Third, they
mention that "environmental regulation reduces the "uncertainty that
investments to address the environment will be valuable". Fourth,
they advance that outside pressure, which includes the regulatory framework
firms have to comply with, is able to overcome organizational inertia and
motivate innovation. The fifth reason put forward by the authors is that
"regulation levels the transitional playing field" in the sense that regulation
ensures that companies do not gain an unfair advantage until new and improved
technologies are proven. The sixth and final argument pertains to an important
nuance between the effect of regulation on innovation and competitiveness of
firms in that compliance costs arising from environmental regulations might not
always be offset by benefits brought by product innovations. Crucially, Porter
and Van der Linde contend that most benefits occurring from increased innovation
will arise in the medium to the long term due to the required time span for the
innovation to bear fruits. Hence the existence of a lag between the implementation
of an environmental regulation and a signal on innovation or economic performance
metrics of firms is likely.

Due to its unorthodox nature, the Porter Hypothesis generated a strong debate 
among economists during the late 1990's and the early 2000's
[@jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationCompetitiveness1995].
@ambecPorterHypothesis202013 provide a clear overview of the various arguments
proponents used to defend the *PH*. They define a first set of studies which
underlines the fact that firms are driven by individuals who might not
satisfy the assumptions of rationality required for firms to be deemed
profit-maximizers. Indeed, managerial risk-aversion, resistance to change
[@aghionCorporateGovernanceCompetition1997], and
a combination of lacking information and the cognitive capabilities to
process the latter [@gabel2001firm] may cause a mismatch between the utility
maximizing behaviors of the management and the firm as a whole. Akin to this
principal agent issue, @ambecTheoreticalFoundationPorter2002 argue that managers
may exhibit rent-seeking behavior by retaining private information on
the true costs of technological innovations that would improve productivity
and the environmental performance of the firm. This essentially
follows the organizational inertia and learning effects put forward by
@porterNewConceptionEnvironmentCompetitiveness1995 and outlined above.

A second strand of the theoretical literature explore the role of market
failures beyond the pure environmental externalities generated by pollution
and how increased environmental regulations could overcome them.
Examples of this strand include situations where firms are first movers
within international markets characterized by imperfect competition where
domestic production may increase as a result of more stringent environmental
regulation [@simpsonTaxingVariableCost1996]. Another common market failure
that could lead to the coexistence of the *PH* alongside profit-maximizing firms
are information asymmetries between households and firms.
The main idea here is that by setting industry standards or labels, firms
are able to credibly communicate the environmental benefits of their products
and overcome the asymmetry [@ambecSurvolFondementsTheoriques2007].
Finally, the non-exclusive nature of R&D may lead to spillovers from the
innovating firm to other firms in the industry. This may lead the economy
to be in a bad equilibrium where firms invest too little in environmental
technologies. If this is indeed the case, then regulations can level the playing
field among firms and lead to a move to the higher, more R&D intensive
equilibrium [@mohrTechnicalChangeExternal2002].

On the empirical front, much has been written to reinforce the initially very
theoretical debate surrounding the Porter Hypothesis.
To facilitate its analysis, @jaffeEnvironmentalRegulationInnovation1997
divided the original hypothesis into three distinct ones. What is known as
the "Strong Porter Hypothesis" (*SPH*) links environmental regulation to firm
competitiveness. The "Weak Porter Hypothesis" (*WPH*) links regulation to innovation,
and the "Narrow Porter Hypothesis" argues that flexible market-based
regulations are more effective in generating innovation than stricter
command-and-control policies^[Since we will focus on the former two
two hypotheses, we will not elaborate on the "narrow" hypothesis in this
literature review.].

The empirical literature analyzing the weak version of the Porter Hypothesis
usually operationalizes innovation as R&D expenditures or through
(aggregate or sector specific) patent counts. On the right hand side, the
independent variable, environmental policy stringency, was initially proxied
by pollution abatement costs before being more holistically estimated via the
use of indicators such as the Environmental Policy Stringency (*EPS*) indicator
developed by the OECD [@kruseMeasuringEnvironmentalPolicy2022] or national
firm-level surveys
