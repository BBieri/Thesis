I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Prof. JoÃ«lle Noailly for
her supervision without which the present work would not exist. Her guidance
on how to adress methodological issues as well as her insight in the field
of environmental economics proved to be invaluable in the writing of this
thesis.
Additionally, I would like to thank Prof. James Hollway for the co-supervision
of this thesis and in particular for the collaboration within the PANARCHIC project
which allowed me to continuously refine my programming skills and discover the
importance of social network analysis to further refine our understanding
of social issues.
Furthermore, I would like to thank Henrique Sposito, Jael Tan and Esther
Peev, all members of the PANARCHIC team, for their help.
