This paper investigates the link between environmental policy stringency,
innovation and firm competitiveness which is commonly known as the Porter Hypothesis in
OECD countries between 1990 and 2015.
Unlike previous studies, we consider the evolution of international
environmental policy and extend the traditional domestic policy analysis by using a
network analysis approach to understanding international environmental
cooperation patterns over time. To investigate the relationship between international
cooperation and innovation or firm competitiveness, we define two country-level
measures of embeddedness in the international governance network; strength and
transitivity.
We find that domestic environmental policy stringency has a positive effect on
innovation as proxied by R&D expenditures but not on patent counts. Furthermore,
we find that social capital proxied by transitivity, which is conducive to a
stable international policy environment positively affects innovation
but not competitiveness. Finally, the impact of the cooperative intensity,
proxied by strength is not consistent across specifications and is consistently
smaller than the transitivity estimates. We thus find that the combination
of stricter environmental policy measures and a stable international governance
environment is conducive to innovation.
